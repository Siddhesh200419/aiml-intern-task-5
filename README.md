# Task 5: Decision Tree & Random Forest Classifier

## Dataset
Heart Disease Dataset from Kaggle

## Tasks Performed
- Trained Decision Tree and Random Forest
- Visualized tree
- Controlled overfitting using `max_depth`
- Compared accuracy of both models
- Interpreted feature importance
- Used 5-fold Cross-Validation

## Results
- Decision Tree Accuracy: 84%
- Random Forest Accuracy: 98%
